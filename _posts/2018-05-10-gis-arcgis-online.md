Here is an good article on [managing ArcGIS Online credits](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/administration/five-strategies-and-tools-for-managing-credits-in-arcgis-online/?adbsc=social_20180509_2323361&adbid=994231781250363393&adbpl=tw&adbpr=41418096). As someone that has had issues managing credits and accidentally burned through some, I found it helpful.
